    <h2>ABOUT ME</h2>
    <p>My name is Dana and I am 32 years old. I am currently a student in the Interactive Design Diploma Program for Graphic Design at SAIT.<br>
        Some fun things about me is that I have one dog, a Husky mix, named Opie. He is a handful but keeps life entertaining and fun.<br> 
        I also have a side business where I make and sell soaps (and handmade jewelry), called "Opie Soaps".<br></p>
        <aside>
            <h4>(Here is a sneak peek at my new and improved logo for "Opie Soaps")</h4>
           <figure>
            <img src="./images/Opie_Soaps_Logo.jpg" height="200" width="210" alt="Opie Soaps text in circular logo">
            <figcaption style="font-style: italic;">Opie Soaps Logo 2023</figcaption>
            </figure>  
        </aside>
    <p>One of my favourite quotes, and an excellent mantra to live by, is <i>"Failure is not an option. It is essential."</i><br>Funnily enough, I heard this quote on the first day of orientation at SAIT.<br>
    Ever since then I have been continually reminding myself to embrace both success and failure.<br></p>
    <p>When I am not at school or doing homework, I enjoy reading and watching TV. Here is the Amazon link for my favourite book: <a href="https://www.amazon.ca/Pride-Prejudice-Jane-Austen/dp/1398812188/ref=sr_1_4?crid=2DN6BLW09HQ8T&keywords=pride+and+prejudice&qid=1698547727&s=books&sprefix=pride+and+prejudice%2Cstripbooks%2C104&sr=1-4">Pride &amp; Prejudice.</a> 
    <br>Also, here is the link to my favourite TV show: <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1124373/">Sons of Anarchy.</a> You should definitely check them both out! <br>
    Don't get me started on my favourite movies. There are way too many! Well, actually...no, get me started!</p>
    <aside>
        <h4>Here's a quick list of my favourites:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Forest Gump</li>
        <li>Armageddon</li>
        <li>You've Got Mail</li>
        <li>The Grinch (the one with Jim Carrey, obviously!)</li>
    </ul>
    </aside>
    <p>Anyways, continue reading for more information about me, including my hobbies and photos of my design work.</p>
